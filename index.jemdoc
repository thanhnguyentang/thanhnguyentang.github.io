*Intro.* I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Department of Computer Science, Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 
working with [https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Home.html Raman Arora]. Prior to that, I was an Associate Research Fellow at the Applied AI Institute, Deakin University from Jul 2021 to June 2022 
and completed my PhD there in Feb 2022. I was a researcher at Ulsan National University of Science and Technology (UNIST) from Mar 2018 to Dec 2018, 
and I obtained my Master there in 2018. I was also serving as a ML technical consultant for a local startup company on NLP product solutions. 
\n


*Research interest.* Machine Learning. 

I’m always actively open to research collaborations and chat!

I created the [https://thanhnguyentang.github.io/mlten.html "ML Theory Exchange Network" Discord channel] (currently 66 members as of 25 Oct 2021) 
to connect ML-theory passionate self-learners (like myself) with senior researchers for exchanging ideas and learning resources.
