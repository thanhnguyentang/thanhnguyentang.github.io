# Research Roadmap   
Roadmap for Theory of DL (Goal: a unifying theory for representation and generalization in DL that connects many related disciplines and ideas. This unifying theory, if exists, shoud require a graceful interplay among Information Theory, Probability Theory, Optimal Transport and Optimization): 
* Some (important) AI paradigms to play with: RL, GAN, neural density estimation.  
* Understand RL via OT;  
* Understand GAN dynamics via OT or Information Theory;  
* Understand generalization in DNNs via Information Theory perspective or OT (e.g., [Stronger generalization bounds for deep nets via a compression approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05296.pdf));   
* A Unifying framework for OT, IT, DL, Statistics and Optimization (hint: Variational inference is an optimization-based inference)
* Use these new insights to improve practical algorithms and find impactful, empirical applications. 

# Scientist Roadmap 

There are many researchers I wish to learn from their work and research styles for my research career. Basicially, in my perspective, they, in a novel but insightful manner, bring Probability Theory, Statistics, Optimal Transport, Information Theory, and Optimization into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Their research gives novel perspectives, has sufficient impact on our community (based on 4 metrics: (i) potential applications, (ii) number of citations, (iii) generalization of technical knowledge, and (iv) giving new understanding of MLAI problems). This generic style is exactly the one I am pursuing. But to make this task more manageable and doable, I try to make a project-based roadmap; that is, a small (varying) list based on my <b>current</b> projects (so once a project is done, the list might change):
