## New posts at [Machine Learning Side Notes](http://mlsidenotes.blogspot.com/): 
I find it easier for future reference to organize posts by tags and archive in a searchable manner. Therefore, from now on, I will instead write in my new blog at [Machine Learning Side Notes](http://mlsidenotes.blogspot.com/). I still use this github blog as my online CV though.
