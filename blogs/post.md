## [New!] [Machine Learning & Artificial General Intelligence (MLAGI) Google+ collection](https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/YMk7dE): 
I have found myself recently active on Google+ after I had read [Professor Yann LeCun's Google+ post](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+YannLeCunPhD/posts/gurGyczzsJ7) (directed from [Professor Truyen Tran's post](https://letdataspeak.blogspot.com/2016/12/machine-learning-four-years-after.html)). I find that Google+ is very convenient for me to record interesting ideas that I have read and to write my instanteneous thoughts about Machine Learning and Research as I am using Google Search and other Google products extensively. Thus, I have decided to start a Google+ collection to serve that purpose. 

**Why the name Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?** AGI looks for general principles of intelligence, specifically of learning and inference. Those who disapprove of AGI believe that intelligence is simply possession of task-specific knowledge (e.g., million of facts from data) and heuristics injected into a machine, and there are no such general principles behind intelligence. In other words, they believe that intelligence is domain knowledge from data arranged in an efficient way for learning and inference. For me, while it is undoubtedly helpful to incorporate vast amounts of domain knowledge to a machine (assuming with some efficient heuristics), it does not necessarily mean that general principles do not exist. I prefer their combination in designing machine learning algorithms, but have found myself biased to and interested in AGI. The MLAGI Google+ collection will serve as my instant blog about issue in particular and about machine learning in general (and probably some random stuff too but of course related to ML research, e.g., paper writing). 
## New posts at [Machine Learning Side Notes](http://mlsidenotes.blogspot.com/): 
I find it easier for future reference to organize posts by tags and archive in a searchable manner. Therefore, from now on, I will instead write in my new blog at [Machine Learning Side Notes](http://mlsidenotes.blogspot.com/). I still use this github blog as my online CV though.
