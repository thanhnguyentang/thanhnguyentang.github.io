<td align="left"><p><b>Bio</b>. I am an incoming tenure-track assistant professor in the <a href="https://ds.njit.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Department of Data Science</a>, <a href="https://computing.njit.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Ying Wu College of Computing</a> at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). I am currently a postdoc at Johns Hopkins University (with <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Home.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Raman Arora</a>). 
Prior to that, I did my PhD in Computer Science at the Applied AI Institute, Deakin University, Australia,  
my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea, 
my B.Eng. in Electronic and Communication Engineering (Talented Engineering Program) at Danang University of Science and Technology, Vietnam. 
</p>
<p>I was awarded the Alfred Deakin Medal for Doctoral Theses (for the most outstanding theses), 2022.
</p>
<p><b>Research Interest</b>. I am interested in the foundations of machine learning and its intersection with optimization and theoretical computer science. 
My research goal is to enrich our understanding of the underlying algorithmic principles for learning and thereby design practical machine learning systems that are more efficient, robust and socially responsible. 
The current research topics include sequential decision making (RL, MARL, game theory), responsible AI (differential privacy, machine unlearning, robustness), and LLMs (reasoning, training dynamics, generalization).  
I am also interested in the application of ML in high-stakes settings.
