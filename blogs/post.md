A collection of my notes drafted for various topics that I have investigated. I try the best to be self-contained when possible. A new blog post every week with probability of $1/3$. Most posts are in RL, Variational Inference and Information Theory with the goal in mind that they must be both *empirically* and *theoretically* insightful.
