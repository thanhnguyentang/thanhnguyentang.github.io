# On the importance of asking questions   
By [Danial Ally and Jun Liu](https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~junliu/) 
> Most people assume that they know answers. Their assumptions actually hold them back from knowing the truth. Truly, you want to ask questions to gain clarity about the direction you are heading. The fact is that many people don't ask any questions as they habitually guess their way by creating answers for themselves. To become a great researcher, don't answer your questions, but question your answers. When you need to know the facts, you must inquire, not just make assumptions. Many people don't want to ask questions because it exposes them to confront the reality of their circumstance, which may scare them. Moreover, asking questions forces them into the laborious task of thinking, which is why they fail to ask questions.

In thinking on important questions, you will often reach an apparent dead end, with no where to go. Here are some techniques for moving forward again: 
* Define your terms 
* Go multiple (What are some of the conceivable answers?) 
* Go meta (What would an answer look like? What properties would it have?)  
* Retreat (to a clearer question that you can make progress on)

* Don't be impressed by what you don't understand.  
* Don't try to impress others by what they don't understand.
* You should be brave, ambitious but also humble and transparant.
* Humble before the great task - Understanding the mind. Nature is subtle but not devious. It is waiting to be discovered if we can only see.
* Your thoughts are, potentially, of great value.


# On thinking carefully and productively  
By [Richard Sutton in DLRLSS](https://twitter.com/azin_asg/status/1157418170438656002/photo/1)
> The best way (to think carefully and productively) is to write for yourself and discuss with others.


# Modified wisdom from [Sam Altman](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)   
* Trust the potential instead of the linear growth, be patient and be pleasantly surprised (like momentum compounds, it gains acceleration along the way you build it).
* **Self-belief** (balanced with self-awareness)  
* **Work hard. Grit. Without burn out. [Grit is more important than intelligence](https://thanhnguyentang.github.io/blogs/hype_circle)**.
* **Grit comes from getting back up after getting knocked down**. 
* **Don't be afraid to work on what you really want to work on. Be bold**.
* **Optimistic and persistent**: self-doubt, giving up too soon and not pushing hard enough are enemy of success. 
* Think from first principles, try to generate new ideas. You fail many times to be right once.
* Be able to convince people of what you believe: First, you genuinely believe in it with clear thinking - Second, use plain and concise language to communicate. 
* Reward is good but sometimes it is also good to take risks. 
* Once find a right thing to do, get unstoppable focus on accomplishing it quickly. 
* Build up leverage, something that is hard to be done by someone else but you. 
* Build network. The best way is to help people as much as you can. 
* Equity. 
* Internally driven. Work to impress yourself, not others. Work in areas that are important to you.
