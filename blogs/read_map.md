# Research Roadmap  
My research road map: 
* Understand RL via OT;  
* Understand GAN dynamics via OT or Information Theory;  
* Understand generalization in DNNs via Information Theory perspective or OT;  
* Use these new insights to improve practical algorithms and find impactful, empirical applications. 

## 1. Understanding learning dynamics of Reinforcement Learning via Optimal Transport      

* Statistics and Samples in Distributional Reinforcement Learning. 

## 2. Generalization in deep neural networks (especially the connection with compression) 

* [Stronger generalization bounds for deep nets via a compression approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05296.pdf) 


## 3. On Unifying Statistics and Optimization 

Hint: Variation inference is an optimization-based inference. 


# Scientist Roadmap   
An incomplete list of researchers that I like to learn from their research styles. In my perspective, they, in a novel but insightful manner, bring Probability Theory, Statistics, Optimal Transport, Information Theory, and Optimization into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Their research gives novel perspectives, has sufficient impact on our community (based on 4 metrics: (i) potential applications, (ii) number of citations, (iii) generalization of technical knowledge, and (iv) giving new understanding of MLAI problems)
