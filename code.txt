I advocate "Engaged Machine-Learningism": building learning theory and algorithms for contemporary problems with collaborative effort.  

The goal of my research is
to seek better understanding and develop computationally and provably efficient /learning/ and /decision-making/ methods in modern practical settings 
of machine learning. 
My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning with statistics and optimization (Statistical Learning and Optimization Lab - *SLOpt Lab*).

 (including bandits and online learning); overparameterized neural networks; adversarial robust learning;
