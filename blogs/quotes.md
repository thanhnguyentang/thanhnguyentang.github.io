* If you are lucky enough to find a way of life you love, you have to find the courage to live it. (John Irving) 

* All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them. (Galileo Galilei)

* You time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other opinions drown your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow know that you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. (Steve Jobs)
