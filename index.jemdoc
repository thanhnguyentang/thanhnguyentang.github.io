== About Me  
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, 
working with [https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Home.html Raman Arora]. I did my PhD research in [https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/publications/ the Applied AI Institute], Deakin University (Australia) in 2022, and did my Master research in Computer Science and Engineering in [http://sailab.kaist.ac.kr/publications/ the Statistical AI Lab], Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (South Korea) in 2018. 
== Research Interests   
My research is on the theory of machine learning (ML) under societal constraints motivated by
safe, trustworthy, and responsible AI.  I have so far focused primarily
on data-driven decision making, including contextual bandits and reinforcement learning, and have started to look into non-interactive settings. 
I am interested in exploring algorithmic principles and fundamental limits for learning and decision making under societal constraints, 
focusing on the following questions:  
- *Statistical complexity*: what structural conditions of a class of models characterize the sample complexity required to learn these new problems?
- *Algorithm designs*: how to design efficient learning algorithms that adaptively exploit such structures?   

I am also interested in open problems in statistical learning theory. And even more broadly, I am interested in all algorithmic and theoretical aspects of ML, especially at the intersection with theoretical computer science 
to place modern societal problems on a firmer foundation.
