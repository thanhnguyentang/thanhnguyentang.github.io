This is not mine but just my summary of [1]. **Caveat**: Some points might not perfectly reflect the original ideas of the authors. 

* Keep the main message clear
    * Think about what message you want to tell your readers. 
    * The paper tends to be rejected if the discussion is so weak. 
    * Put the results in a global context to demonstrate their originality and significance. 

* In the discussion
    * Speculation, e.g., future research needs to be explored, is ok, but not too much. 
    * Explain why the findings are interesting and affect an understanding of the topic. 
    * Convince the readers that your findings are robust and you have considered alternative explanations. 
* Follow logical structure
    * In paragraph level, the first sentence for the context, the body for the new ideas, the final sentence for the conclusion. 
    * In paper level, the introduction for the context, the results for the new content, and the discussion for the conclusion. 
    * Focus the paper on one single key message. 
    * Detail the problem: Why shoud I care about your experiments and results until you tell me why. 

* State your case with confidence
    * State clearly "what's new and compelling" and every section should support that one single key finding.  
    * Don't be turgid in statements.
    * Don't muddy the science.
    * Don't make the readers work hard to understand the conveyed idea. 

* Aim for a wide audience
    * Make a clear, succint, declarative title. 
    * Get to the point in the title. 

* Other points
    * Recall that editors and peer reviewers are looking for results that are interesting and useful to the field. 
    * The purpose of a scientific paper is to convey the findings. 
    * Scientific writing is factual, concise and evidence-based.
