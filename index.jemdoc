I am currently a postdoctoral researcher of the Applied AI Institute at Deakin University. 
Prior to that, I was a PhD student at Deakin University from Jan 2019 to Jul 2021, 
was a researcher at Ulsan National University of Science and Technology (UNIST) from Mar 2018 to Dec 2019, 
and obtained my Master at UNIST in 2018. \n


~~~
I work on machine learing with the goal of 
developing advanced data-driven machine learning and statistical methods for 
learning and reasoning in complex, structured models over large, structured datasets. 
In particular, I am interested in improving statistical efficiency and generalization 
beyond i.i.d. setting of machine and reinforcement learning systems via imposing\/exploiting 
minimal structural inductive biases. 
Currently, I focus on: (i) (offline) RL theory (with neural function approximation), and (ii) robust generalization beyond i.i.d. setting,
(iii) ML applications.  See more at [proposal.html my research proposals].
