I am currently an Associate Research Fellow and was a PhD candidate of the Applied AI Institute at Deakin University. 
Prior to that, I was a researcher at Ulsan National University of Science and Technology (UNIST) from Mar 2018 to Dec 2019, 
and I obtained my Master at UNIST in 2018. \n

The goal of my research is
to develop better understanding and tractable methods for /learning/ and /decision-making/ in modern practical settings with strong theoretical guarantees. 
My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning with statistics and optimization. My research areas: 

- Sequential decision-making under uncertainty (e.g., reinforcement learning, bandit, online learning),
- Robust generalization (e.g. OOD, adversarial learning)
- Statistical inference (e.g. semiparametric models and causal inference)

~~~ 
Our Institute at Deakin University have several PhD openings in offline learning and causal inference. Please contact me for more information.

I created the [https://thanhnguyentang.github.io/mlten.html "ML Theory Exchange Network" Discord channel] (currently 66 members as of 25 Oct 2021) 
to connect ML-theory passionate self-learners (like myself) with senior researchers for exchanging ideas and learning resources. 

I have been also serving as a ML technical consultant for a local startup company on NLP product solutions.
