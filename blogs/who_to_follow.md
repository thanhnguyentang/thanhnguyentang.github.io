I am interested in a wide range of machine learning topics (listed below) and wish to develop my understanding toward them. That is, 
I want to bounce off my research around these topics and wish to develop sufficient expertise in these. This is my long-term learning yet very interesting to me. For that purpose, I'd like to keep a blog post on the high-profiled scientists in these topics so that I can learn from them and update about their research. This list does not say anything about the actual ranking of these scientists (and any others) by any mean but rather my personal preference for updating my research. I also keep this list updated occationally.
