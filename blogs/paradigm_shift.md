A summary on "[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/kuhnsyn.html)" by Thomas S. Kuhn: 

* Science cannot operate without some paradigm.

* A paradigm can be thought of as a set of beliefs and assumptions based on which research questions are created and new knowledge is established.  

* Normal science exploits a paradiagm.  

* When a paradigm encounters anomaly (in the form of novelties of fact or theory), paradigm shift can (gradually) takes place. 

* As a scientist, how to deal with anomaly when practicing some paradigm?

    * Those who pause and examine every anomaly would not get much done because an anomaly is more than just another puzzle in the current paradigm; it requires more effort. 

    * When an anomaly becomes more recognized and serious, people start to look at it. They isolate the anomaly and try to understand it by giving it a structure. They try to extend the current paradigm to explain for the anomaly. 

    * If the current paradigm cannot be modified to handle the anomaly, a new paradigm must arise to account for the anomaly. In the meantime, you can choose to keep exploiting the current paradigm and ignore the anomaly for other people, or you can choose to exploring new paradigms to account for the anomaly.
