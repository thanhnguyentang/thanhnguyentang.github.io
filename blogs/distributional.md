Reframing (part of) a learning problem as learning and optimization over the space of probability distributions. 
Here are some important papers to start with: 


* [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) (minimax)
* [Distributional reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887) (still, minimax)
* [Distribution-Agnostic Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04766v1.pdf) (minimax on the space of probability distributions or distributionally robust optimization)
