I am currently an associate research fellow and a PhD candidate of the Applied AI Institute at Deakin University. 
Prior to that, I was a researcher at Ulsan National University of Science and Technology (UNIST) from Mar 2018 to Dec 2019, 
and I obtained my Master at UNIST in 2018. \n


~~~ 
The goal of my research is to develop a better understanding and design more efficient data-driven machine learning methods for 
learning and decision-making in modern practical settings for robustness, scalability and statistical efficiency. 
My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning with statistics and optimization, with the key highlights:
- Bandits and reinforcement learning (especially offline learing and neural function approximation)
- Robust generalization beyond i.i.d. setting (e.g., using Information Botllteneck and causal inference) 
- Distributional reinforcement learning 
~~~


I publish under Thanh Tang Nguyen (old name arrangement) and Thanh Nguyen-Tang (new one).
