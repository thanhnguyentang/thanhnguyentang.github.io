<p>To the call of Issac Newton and Richard Sutton on thinking hard and productively, it’s probably a good time to make a dedicated post on 
how to think hard and productively:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inference</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Deductive inference (“Suy luận logic” in Vietnamese):
        <ul>
          <li>Totally based on the stated premises.</li>
          <li>A conclusion is a logical result of the premises.</li>
          <li>Does not generate more information.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Inductive inference (“Suy luận quy nạp” in Vietnamese)
        <ul>
          <li>Incorporates general knowledge with the initial premises.</li>
          <li>A conclusion is NOT a logical result of the premises but we can assign a likelihood to a conclusion.</li>
          <li>Does generate more information beyond the inital premises.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment"><strong>Thought experiments</strong></a>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What</strong>: To reason from causes to effects and vice versus.</li>
      <li><strong>How</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Rearrange empirical data in a new way and draw new priori inferences</li>
          <li>Use a different and unusual perspective to look at the empirical data, e.g., 
  Galileo uses the idea of combining objects of different weights to demonstrate that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their weights.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Why cares</strong>?
        <ul>
          <li>Galileo use thought experiment to demonstrate that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their weights</li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Schrodinger’s cat</a> to demonstrate the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is inconsistent.</li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon">Maxwell’s demon</a> to suggest that the second law of thermodynamics might be hypethetically violated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From Prof. David McKay’s thinking style (posted and interpreted by David Duvenuad on <a href="https://twitter.com/PhilippHennig5/status/1332074375835766785">Twitter</a>):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Scientific figures should be pictures, not paintings (Try to show a real example of the phenomenon you want to discuss, rather than just drawing your idea of what it should look like)</li>
      <li>Scientific writing should be correct, clear and concise, in that order. Only when you are sure a statement is correct, should you worry about making it easy to understand, and only then should worry about making it short.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
