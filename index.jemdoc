*Bio*. I am an incoming tenure-track assistant professor in [https://ds.njit.edu/ Department of Data Science], [https://computing.njit.edu/ Ying Wu College of Computing] at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). I am currently a postdoc at Johns Hopkins University (with [https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Home.html Raman Arora]). 
Prior to that, I did my PhD in Computer Science at the Applied AI Institute, Deakin University, Australia,  
my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea, 
my B.Eng. in Electronic and Communication Engineering (Talented Engineering Program) at Danang University of Science and Technology, Vietnam. 


*Research Interest*. I am interested in the foundations of machine learning and its intersection with optimization and theoretical computer science. 
My research goal is to enrich our understanding of the underlying algorithmic principles for learning and thereby design practical machine learning systems that are more efficient, robust and socially responsible. 
My current topics include reinforcement learning, responsible AI, and LLM reasoning.  I am also interested in the application of ML in high-stakes settings.

I am seeking highly motivated and self-driven Ph.D. students with a strong mathematical background in machine learning and good programming skills (Python) to join my research group at the Ying Wu College of Computing at NJIT (tuition waiver and PhD stipend via RA/TA support), starting as early as Fall 2025. 
Prospective PhD students are strongly encouraged to email me where you enclose your CV and transcript, and a brief paragraph describing research experience and areas of interest.


Students at all levels (including high school) are also strongly encouraged to email me if 
interested in doing research in ML!

*About NJIT*. NJIT is a Carnegie R1 Doctoral University (the highest level of research activity) and one of the nation’s leading public polytechnic universities. 
NJIT was ranked 68th in Machine Learning and Algorithms & Complexity categories by CSrankings.org, and 42th and 84th in Top Public Schools and National Universities, respectively, by U.S. News & World Reports. 
New Jersey is the “Garden of Innovation State,” in reference to its longstanding tradition as a hub for scientific and technological innovation. Located in Newark’s University Heights, NJIT is part of a vibrant ecosystem of high technology players and is just a 30-minute train ride from New York City, also known today as "Silicon Alley." These offer NJIT students and graduates ample opportunities for internships, entrepreneurship and employment.
