== The Equal-Opportunity Theorem 

*Theorem.* You can make a big difference and impact in ML (and consequently in life) regardless of how poor your background (financially, geographically, academically, ...) is. 
The necessary condition is that you are a decent human and highly (self-)motivated.  

*Proof.* I am trying my best to prove this theorem by my own life, and I hope you also join the force too.
